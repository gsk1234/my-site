    <h2 class="section-title">Connecting Women Entrepreneurs Across Asia</h2>
    <p>SWIFTConnect is our latest flagship venture, pioneered in 2023. We believe that financial literacy is more than understanding numbers; it's about empowering women to realise their entrepreneurial dreams. Through SWIFTConnect, we organise workshops, provide mentorship and build communities so that women can learn, grow and flourish together.</p>

    <h3>Our Dream</h3>
    <p>Our dream is to reach every woman in India and across Asia, equipping them with resources to transform their ideas into thriving businesses. We aim to ensure that no woman is left behind because of a lack of knowledge or financial support.</p>

    <h3>Our Support, Our Commitment</h3>
    <p>We have supported many groups of women who are ready to grow their enterprises. Here are a few examples:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Arti Rani Mahato and Group:</strong> Aspiring entrepreneurs eager to build sustainable livelihoods.</li>
      <li><strong>Yangmichon V and Group:</strong> Women seeking capital to expand their small businesses in rural villages.</li>
      <li><strong>Toptena and Group:</strong> Farmers needing financial assistance to purchase equipment and seeds.</li>
      <li><strong>Promila Choudhary and Group:</strong> Home‑based artisans looking to scale their handicraft production.</li>
    </ul>
