    <h2 class="section-title">Our Story</h2>
    <p>At the core of Sustaining Women in Financial Turmoil (SWIFTmfi) lies a simple yet profound belief: financial empowerment for women is the cornerstone of sustainable development. Born from a vision to challenge and transform the conventional financial landscape that often leaves the most vulnerable behind, SWIFTmfi champions the idea that when women rise, entire communities flourish.</p>

    <h3>The Genesis</h3>
    <p>SWIFTmfi was founded by Gobhanu Korisepati with a mission to bridge financial gaps for women worldwide. What began as a modest student‑led initiative has grown into a global movement, anchored on the principle that even the smallest opportunity can spark monumental change.</p>

    <h3>Growth and Global Impact</h3>
    <p>Since 2019, SWIFTmfi has expanded to serve borrowers across more than 77 countries, reaching over 74,000 individuals. Through strategic partnerships and unwavering dedication, we have enabled over 3200+ loans that have helped women start businesses, sustain their families, and uplift their communities. In 2023, we introduced SWIFTConnect – a flagship venture designed to connect entrepreneurs, provide financial literacy workshops and scale impact.</p>

    <h3>The Philosophy Behind Our Mission</h3>
    <p>Our philosophy is rooted in compassion, inclusivity and empowerment. We believe that sustainable development thrives when women are provided with the resources and knowledge they need to lead. Every program we initiate, every loan we disburse, is grounded in the idea that women are powerful agents of change when given the opportunity.</p>

    <h3>A Global Influence</h3>
    <p>Through advocacy, innovation and collaboration, SWIFTmfi has become a beacon for micro‑finance institutions worldwide. Our work has been recognized in over 180 media outlets, and our founder has received prestigious awards for driving social change. Yet, we remain grounded in our mission to impact individual lives.</p>

    <h3>Join Our Mission</h3>
    <p>You can be a part of our journey by spreading awareness, volunteering or contributing to our programs. Together, we can build a future where women everywhere can pursue their dreams without financial barriers.</p>
