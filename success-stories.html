    <p>SWIFT has helped countless women become financially independent and scale up their businesses to the next level. Below are a few starter stories to show SWIFT’s incredible efforts in supporting women financially.</p>
    <div class="cards">
      <div class="card">
        <h3>01 &ndash; Rasha, 38</h3>
        <p>Rasha lives with her family in difficult circumstances but aspires to own a beauty salon. Through our aid in supplementing a $2,125 loan, she overcame financial hardships and transformed her home‑based business into a large, independent beauty center in the city of Ibrid.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="card">
        <h3>02 &ndash; Haneen, 28</h3>
        <p>Haneen wishes to become an entrepreneur as this can serve as a consistent income for her family. Through SWIFT, we allowed her dream to be fulfilled by providing a loan that she later used to buy clothes for people of different ages and styles.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="card">
        <h3>03 &ndash; Mehrona, 22</h3>
        <p>Mehrona is a seamstress in the Temurmalik region. With the loan she received from SWIFT, she bought a new sewing machine and materials, enabling her to increase her income significantly. This support has allowed her to grow her business and better provide for her family.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="card">
        <h3>04 &ndash; Valeria, 23</h3>
        <p>Valeria runs a small clothing business. When COVID‑19 affected supply chains and reduced foot traffic, she needed additional funds to keep her company afloat. Our emergency loan helped her restock inventory and adapt her business to online sales channels.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="card">
        <h3>05 &ndash; Samruai, 60</h3>
        <p>Samruai is a farmer who tends to a small herd of cows. She sought a loan to purchase additional cattle, which would allow her to increase milk production and boost her income. SWIFT provided the necessary funds, and today her farm is thriving.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="card">
        <h3>06 &ndash; Zarmina, 30</h3>
        <p>Zarmina runs a family grocery shop in a rural village. Limited access to capital prevented her from stocking a wide range of products. Our micro‑loan enabled her to expand her inventory and attract more customers, leading to higher profits.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="card">
        <h3>07 &ndash; Nisha, 35</h3>
        <p>Nisha dreamt of starting an eco‑friendly craft business. With SWIFT’s support, she obtained the materials and training required to turn her passion into a full‑time livelihood. Her sustainable products are now sold throughout her community.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="card">
        <h3>08 &ndash; Fatima, 27</h3>
        <p>Fatima works as a tailor but lacked the funds to upgrade her equipment. A SWIFT loan allowed her to invest in modern machinery, doubling her output and enabling her to take on larger contracts. She now employs other women, sharing her success with her neighbours.</p>
